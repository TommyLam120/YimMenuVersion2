# 📜 YimMenu Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, programming experience, race, gender identity, sexual identity, or personal background.

As a rule of thumb, **any comment or behavior that is not relevant to the project or its contributions is prohibited**.


## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive and inclusive environment include:

- Treating everyone with respect and cordiality
- Welcoming new contributors
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of **unacceptable behavior** include:

- Trolling or intentionally disruptive behavior
- Political discussions, symbols, or imagery (including Pepe, Wojaks, etc.)
- Racial slurs or hateful language
- Using avatars or usernames that display affiliations with extremist organizations
- Harassment, threats, or intimidation
- Doxxing or attempts to expose personal information
- Submitting leaked, stolen, or otherwise copyrighted code
- Promoting unrelated personal projects
- Attempting to recruit contributors for unrelated projects
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional environment


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the **right and responsibility** to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

They may also temporarily or permanently ban **any contributor** for behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, abusive, or harmful to the community.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to **all project spaces**, including:

- This GitHub repository  
- The official Matrix server: https://matrix.to/#/#yimmenu:matrix.org  

This Code of Conduct **does not apply to the actual menu codebase itself**, but rather to community interaction, collaboration, and contribution environments.


## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported in the official Matrix room.

All comments, issues, pull requests, or contributions violating this Code of Conduct will be **swiftly removed**, and users may be **muted, kicked, or permanently banned** if they show no intention of contributing respectfully.


## Why Have a Code of Conduct?

Unfortunately, the game hacking and wider gaming community is often filled with:

- [Harassment](https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-has-banned-over-350-000-players-for-racism-1846975082)
- [Bigotry](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/images/smilies/black.png)
- [Organized harassment campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_%28harassment_campaign%29)
- [Extremist online communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//pol/)

These groups tend to drive away contributors and slow development by engaging in pointless hostility and disruption.

This Code of Conduct exists to ensure such individuals are removed **before they can negatively impact the project**. This is a matter of **basic decency**, not ideology. If you feel that being prohibited from harassment or slurs is an unreasonable restriction, then this community is simply not the right fit for you.
